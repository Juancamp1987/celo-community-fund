# Celo Community Fund Status

## Overview 

This repository to is to keep a canonical history of the Celo Community Fund status and intiatives that have utilized the fund. Previously, the data was segregated and hard to know the current initiatives that were in draft proposal phase, intiatives that had spend approval and the remaining funds avialable to them. It was also difficult to have a high level overview of the total funds.

## What is the fund?

The Community Fund provides for general upkeep of the Celo platform. CELO holders decide how to allocate these funds through governance proposals. Funds might be used to pay bounties for bugs or vulnerabilities, security audits, or grants for protocol development.

The Community Fund receives assets from three sources:

- The Community Fund obtains a desired epoch reward defined as a fraction of the total desired epoch rewards (governable, initially planned to be 25%). This amount is subject to adjustment up or down in the event of under- or over-spending against the epoch rewards target schedule. The Community Fund epoch rewards may be redirected to bolster the Reserve.

- The Community Fund is the default destination for slashed assets.
- The Community Fund also receives the 'base' portion of transaction fees.
